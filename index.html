                Effective defense goes beyond responding to alerts, it requires understanding attacker behavior, 
                identifying gaps in visibility, and continuously improving detection and response processes. 
                Each investigation is an opportunity to refine security controls and strengthen the overall 
                security posture.

        <p class="lead">
          TryHackMe is my primary hands-on platform for structured cybersecurity learning, 
          where I reinforce theoretical knowledge through guided labs, simulated SOC scenarios, 
          and real world challenges. I use it to develop expertise in alert triage, log analysis, 
          threat detection, incident response, and forensic investigations, while also gaining 
          exposure to offensive security techniques to better understand attacker behaviour. 
          The platform allows me to practice using industry-standard tools and frameworks in a 
          safe, practical environment, bridging the gap between theory and operational readiness 
          for SOC and security engineering roles.
